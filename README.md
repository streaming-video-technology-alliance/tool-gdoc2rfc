# DOCX to RFC XML Converter

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

WARNING: This README.md has been generate by chat GPT. Until further notice, it can contain incorrect documentation. TBD


This open-source Python tool is designed to convert DOCX documents into the XML format used for publishing RFCs (Request for Comments) by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). It consists of three main scripts that work together to facilitate the conversion process. The tool is distributed under the MIT License.

## Installation

To use this DOCX to RFC XML Converter, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/docx-to-rfc-xml-converter.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To convert a DOCX document to RFC XML format, use the following command:

```bash
python extract_docx.py -c config.json
```

For more detailed instructions on how to configure and use each script, refer to the [Scripts](#scripts) section below.

## Configuration

Before running the scripts, you'll need to create a configuration file (`config.json`) to specify the conversion settings. Here's an example configuration file:

```json
{
  "input_dir": "input_docx/",
  "output_dir": "output_xml/",
  "rfc_version": "draft-00",
  "chapter_order": ["intro", "body", "conclusion"],
  "other_options": {
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": "value2"
  }
}
```

- `input_dir`: The directory containing the input DOCX file(s).
- `output_dir`: The directory where the converted RFC XML files will be saved.
- `rfc_version`: The version of the RFC you want to create (e.g., "draft-00").
- `chapter_order`: The order in which chapters should be inserted into the final RFC document.
- `other_options`: Additional options specific to your project.

## Scripts

### extract_docx.py

This script performs the initial conversion of the DOCX document into a series of XML files, one for each chapter. Run it as follows:

```bash
python extract_docx.py -c config.json
```

### extract_references.py

This script processes the XML files generated by `extract_docx.py` and replaces certain patterns to ensure proper referencing in the RFC XML format.

### generate_rfc.py

Using the various XML files generated by the previous scripts, along with generic XML files and the structure provided by `rfc_format.xml`, this script generates the final RFC XML document. Run it as follows:

```bash
python generate_rfc.py -c config.json
```
