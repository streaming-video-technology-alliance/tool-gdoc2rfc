            The FCI and MI objects defined in the present document are
   transferred via the interfaces defined in CDNI <xref target="RFC8006" />. <xref target="RFC8006" />
   describes how to secure these interfaces, protecting the integrity,
   confidentiality and ensuring the authenticity of the dCDN and uCDN.
   The security provide by <xref target="RFC8006" /> should therefore address the above
   security concerns.
